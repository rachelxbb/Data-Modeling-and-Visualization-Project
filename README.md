# Data-Modeling-and-Visualization-Project

### Overview:
It is a project programming in R, to explore the attributes which make a movie popular and make predictions on the popularity of new movies. 


### Data:
The dataset is from 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released before 2016, with 32 continuous and categorical variables before pre-proeccsing.


### Research Methods:
The method here is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for visualizing data with multiple linear regression models, and making a hypothesis.

Backwards Elimination with the adjusted R squared approach is taken for modeling, to see whether dropping one variable would make changes of the model or not, and to reach a parsimonious model.
